# Lab 25 - Hangman

## Lab Goal
You will write a playable game of Hangman.

## Instructions
* You do not need to edit the `HangmanRunner` class.
* Complete all of the methods in the `Hangman` class.  Use the comments in the file as instructions.
* Complete all javadoc comments with the proper tags.

## Tips
* Some helpful string methods you may want to recall are `substring()` and `charAt()`.

## Notes
* The Checkstyle config url is http://www.daveavis.com/cs/checkstyle_SHS.xml
* Make sure you modify the link at the top of your **Readme.md** to reflect your username if you want the badge at the top to represent the status of your code.

## Grading
* 90 - Hangman works (not all-or-nothing)
* 10 - style

Note that these are potential maximums; the computer can only check so much.  If your code passes Checkstyle, but I see non-descriptive variable names, then your style grade will go down.  If your code passes all tests, but I see code that was copied off of the internet or from another student your grade will go *way* down.
